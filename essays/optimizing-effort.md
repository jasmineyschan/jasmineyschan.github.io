### Estimating Effort

The final project for my software engineering class consisted of working in a group to develop an application geared towards the UH community. Having various moving parts to the development process and the need to organize tasks amongst the team, we documented our planning and effort estimation from start to finish. Our effort estimation involved first describing an issue, estimating the amount of effort required to complete it, then completing the issue and recording both the actual coding effort and non-coding effort. When recording my actual effort spent, I took the rudimentary approach of taking note of when I began an issue and when I completed it. Overall, I believe that my record of actual effort is likely not accurate, as I “eyeballed” it. For more accurate data, I would definitely consider using a timer extension on VSCode. Throughout this process, I found that my estimates were often far off, especially for issues that seemed to grow into bigger issues. Despite this, I did find this action of estimating effort helpful as it forced me to think about the various tasks required for an issue, as well as how an issue may be related to a previous task I may have done.

### Future Improvements

For my next project, I plan to implement a similar tracking process; however, when doing the estimates, I would like to spend more time in planning what needs to be done and looking back at prior data to try and improve my estimations. One of the major problems I encountered when doing the estimations for my final project was that while I was working on an issue, sometimes I would discover a new issue or something that needed to be fixed or reimplemented. Rather than creating a sub-issue, I would count this as a part of the original task, which ended up adding the actual time spent. Next time, I want to be more specific about issues so that I can avoid this problem.
