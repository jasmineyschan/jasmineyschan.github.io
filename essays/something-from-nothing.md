Software is an invaluable tool embedded in so many parts of our lives. It can be found everywhere, from the most obvious places, such as your phone and computer, to less obvious ones like your microwave or your stove. Software is what enabled me to write this essay and publish it online for you to see! The idea that you can start from a blank slate and develop a complex product that enables productivity, creativity, and further innovation lends to endless possibilities. 

Throughout my life, I have always been drawn to the idea of creating something. If I had to pinpoint a beginning, I would say this stemmed from my love of reading. As a child, being able to get lost in a bunch of text printed onto a sheet of paper amazed me; I, too, wanted to design my own little world that could make someone forget about the real one. This has continued to be a pattern throughout my life as I discovered skills such as drawing, crocheting, and sewing. While I’m not a pro at all of these hobbies, I can’t say I’m terrible at them. The motivation to create something has always pushed me to learn more and improve. 

The fact that I'm able to take a software engineering course excites me as someone who grew up on the internet. As I continue in my learning, I aim to discover more about what it encompasses. Currently, my knowledge of software engineering is limited to websites. While I understand the basics of building a webpage using HTML and CSS, I hope to further develop my skills in JavaScript and TypeScript to take a simple website to the next level with interactive user interfaces. Having learned various programming languages in school and acquired the skills to create programs, I would like to gain more experience in applying these skills to creating applications. 

Although I have picked up many creative hobbies throughout my life, I fear that I’m notorious for leaving many projects unfinished. This is something I want to overcome in my software engineering course. After the semester is over, I want to continue utilizing the skills I learned to apply to my own personal project and truly create something from nothing, like I have always wanted to.
