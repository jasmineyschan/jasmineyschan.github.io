# DaCommute!

### Overview
**The problem:** A lot of students commute at UH Manoa, whether they drive, take the bus, or ride a moped. As a result, there is often a lot of traffic and it can be difficult to find parking. Additionally, not everyone knows what options are available to get to/around campus.

**The solution:** *DaCommute* will include information about parking zones, available buses and shuttles, and a page to find someone to carpool with. The webpage will take the users location and provide public transportation or vehicle routes and their ETA. Users can log in and create a profile to match with people who can carpool based on distance. 

### Approach
Users can view the website as a guest or they can create a profile to access more features of the website like carpool matching. Admins can monitor the website and its users.

Some mockup pages include:
- Landing page
- Sign in page
- Profile creation page
- Carpool page
- Map of parking lots
- Admin page
- Guest page

### Use case ideas
- New user (guest) goes to the landing page, logs in, gets to the home page, sets up a profile, or continues as guest
- Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, gets to the home page, and can edit the site.
- Carpool user goes to the landing page, logs in, and goes to the carpool page.
- Carpool users are notified of full parking and matches. (Can they respond via text message?)

### Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
- Support reviews of parking spots
- AI summary of reviews
- Push notifications via text letting users know status of parking lot capacity
