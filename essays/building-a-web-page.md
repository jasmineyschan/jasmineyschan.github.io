Learning the basics of HTML and CSS is not a difficult task. Once you have the structure, you can easily create a basic web page with a decent design. However, just like learning any programming language, creating something more complex has a sharper learning curve. When I first started learning how to program, along with JavaScript, I also learned the basics of HTML and CSS. From this, I gained the skills needed to create a web page, though an ugly one, that could hold information. Since then, I had not looked into HTML and CSS further until starting my software engineering class.

Over the past week, I have been working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. After going through the practice assignments and attempting my own recreation of a website, I have realized that there are so many aspects that go into building a website. Considering this, a UI Framework such as Bootstrap can make the process more efficient. In addition to this, today, there are numerous devices you can use to access a web page. This includes smaller screens like a smartphone to larger desktop monitors. With such a wide range of screen sizes and operating systems, using just raw HTML and CSS would require several different versions of the same file to accommodate each. 

In my last assignment for my software engineering class, I had to rebuild a web page using Bootstrap 5. The web page that I decided on was the [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) home page. Initially, I thought that it looked like a simple enough web page; however, as I was building it, I realized that I might have underestimated its complexity, seeing how many different sections it had. Going through this practice assignment, I learned a lot about the different capabilities of containers in Bootstrap, which I found very useful in structuring each portion of the web page. Despite the struggle with trying to align every little element to the original page, I found this to be a fun exercise. Here are some screenshots comparing the original Capital One web page to my recreation:
