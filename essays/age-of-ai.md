For so long I have begun many essays with the same old statement that technology is becoming an indispensable, everyday tool. Today, that’s not such an interesting line anymore, and it has now turned into the line that AI is becoming a normal occurrence. At the rate that AI is growing and spreading, it has taken the position of what the internet was twenty years ago. This is especially apparent in tech spaces and jobs, and in particular, software engineering. 

### Personal Experience with AI
With the rise of AI, it’s important to be responsible and ethical in your usage. Throughout my software engineering course, I have found through my personal experience that AI is something that I can’t avoid using and that I shouldn’t avoid using; however, it is also a tool that I need to be careful with. Initially, at the start of the course, I tried my best to not use AI for the experience and in-class WODs. As the course progressed and the assignments became increasingly time-consuming, I realized that it would be in my best interest to start utilizing AI for certain parts of the class. For each of the following course elements, here are examples of how I used AI:

##### 1. Experience WODs
Asking for help on unclear instructions. For example, I might have pasted a portion of the instructions into the chat and asked “should I do x first?”

##### 2. In-class Practice WODs
Asking for help on implementing a certain requirement, for example, making a navbar collapsable. Since the practice WODs were technically not restricted in time, I did feel less obligation to use AI compared to the regular in-class WODs

##### 3. In-class WODs
Same as the practice WODs, asking for help on implementing a certain requirement.

##### 4. Essays
I did not use AI for this because many of the essays were reflections and I felt that these required my own thinking

##### 5. Final project
Asking for help implementing certain functions, fixing issues, and generating default data. For example, for my project’s default data, I asked CoPilot, “Can you fill out the default data for the Database Items in config/settings.development.json?” I found this helpful so that I could spend my time on the actual application rather than thinking about trivial default data to add.

##### 6. Learning a concept / tutorial
I often used AI for this when instructions were unclear or incomplete

##### 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I sometimes used AI for this when my professor would ask us a question in class

##### 8. Asking or answering a smart-question
I sometimes used AI for this if I had a question.

##### 9. Coding example
I sometimes used AI for examples on how to implement something, for example if I wanted to add a table or field to my database, I might have asked how I could do that in my schema

##### 10. Explaining code
I have often asked AI for help explaining code, especially when a new template is provided to us or when I ask for help implementing something and the AI generates code that I don’t understand.

##### 11. Writing code
I have asked for help with writing code, for example, I have asked CoPilot to implement a feature for my final project.

##### 12. Documenting code
I did not use AI for this as I prefer to write my own comments. I think writing my own documentation also helps me better understand the code.

##### 13. Quality assurance
I have often used AI to help fix code for me, especially with ESLint errors as those issues can be tedious to go through.

### Impact on Learning and Understanding
Having reached the end of my software engineering course, I can say that using AI definitely felt encouraged in this class, especially with the timed assignments. Reflecting on my AI usage, I feel like when I was being careful, it aided my comprehension of confusing concepts. On the other hand, I also felt that using AI hindered my skill development and problem solving abilities. I have had experiences in which, during a time crunch, I had resorted to asking CoPilot to implement a function for me. Generally, I prefer to work through a problem, even if it takes a bit of time; however, I see how this reflects the reality that there will likely always be a time constraint. On the other hand, watching CoPilot work through issues that I provide is eye opening as it gives me insight into how one might analyze a problem and proceed to solve it. 

### Practical Applications
Outside of my software engineering course, AI has many practical applications. There are so many things around us that already use AI. When people talk about AI today, most of the time they are referring to generative AI, but there are many different types. The core of artificial intelligence is learning from data, recognizing patterns, and trying to mimic human intelligence. This is useful in things like navigation, marketing, and personalized chatbots. 

### Challenges and Opportunities
My experience using AI has not been a smooth journey. Oftentimes I have found that when asking CoPilot for help on solving an issue, it will end up going in circles if the problem is a little more complex. In these cases, I have to be more specific with my prompting and direct CoPilot in the right direction. 

### Comparative Analysis
This has been the first semester in which I have taken a class that pushes AI usage, and I expect that there will only be more to come. While I do think that teaching students about using AI responsibly and ethically is important, I definitely think that this level of AI usage should be reserved for higher level courses. In introductory programming classes, it’s important that students are able to learn the skills without using AI as a crutch. This will only hinder their engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development. 

### Future Considerations
Whether I like it or not, AI is in my future and everyone else's. Even now, it is already being incorporated into many of my classes and I can see the structure of classes adapting to account for AI usage. As a student experiencing this for the first time, I have personally disliked the changes that have been happening, though I may be biased as someone who is used to the traditional classroom structure. 

Overall, I am glad that I was able to gain more exposure to using AI and experience the advantages and disadvantages. In future courses, I think that there could be a little more focus on how to use AI effectively.
