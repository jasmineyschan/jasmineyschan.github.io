Throughout my life, I have asked and been asked many questions. It’s good to ask questions when you’re unsure of something; however, some questions simply don’t need to be asked. Even now, when I’m in college, I have had people my age or even older than me ask me questions as if Google doesn’t exist! While I am always happy to answer questions, I sometimes laugh to myself when a friend texts me, “Do you know when [assignment name] is due?” Do I look like the professor? It’s funny that some people will take the time to open their messages, type out a question, and wait for a response. Instead, they could use that time to open up the assignment online and check the due date. Often, I end up opening the assignment myself, checking the due date, and then responding to ensure that I give the right answer. Of course, this question is more acceptable in the case that someone casually asks it in person. 

When I ask the question, “What is a smart question?” I refer to the more technical questions one may ask. Defining what a smart question is requires more than just analyzing the structure of a question. As you can see from my previous example, asking a question should first call for your own research. While the ability to reach out for help and ask questions is a great skill to have, being able to do your own research is just as important. In the context of software engineering, smart questions are essential because, when planning, designing, and implementing a program, one is likely to discover bugs or challenges along the way. 

Stack Overflow is a forum that a software engineer might turn to for help. As I continue my progress in learning software engineering, it’s important that I also understand how to ask a smart question. Searching through Stack Overflow, there are many examples of smart questions, one of which I analyze below:

### A Smart Question
A smart question I came across is from Mark Rogers, who asked: ["What does 'use strict' do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it)

To start with, the title of his post clearly states what he wants to know, which is the function of “use strict” in JavaScript. Considering that I’m currently learning TypeScript, and I often see “use strict” in the JavaScript that TypeScript generates, I found this question interesting. Another thing to note is that the title of this post is searchable. If I ever wanted to know what “use strict” does in JavaScript, I could easily search that question up and find this thread. 

Within his post, Mark describes the context of his question, stating that he tried to run some JavaScript and it gave an error telling him that his code is missing the “use strict” statement. Following this, he adds what he discovered from researching his question before coming to Stack Overflow, and ends the post by stating what he aims to find out from posting this question. These are all smart choices when it comes to posing a question. Looking at this thread, many people also agreed. Underneath the post there are numerous responses that go into depth about why “use strict” is used in JavaScript.

### A Not-So-Smart Question
This question is from user3027665, who made a post titled: ["C File Homework"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20574925/c-file-homework)

Just from the title, you can tell that it may not be an appropriate post because it’s about homework. Even if the title did not contain the word “Homework,” it would still be a bad title since it tells you nothing about the user’s problem. 

One glance at the content of the post and it’s clear that this is not a smart question. The very first line links to the user’s homework assignment, followed by a copy and paste of the assignment. At the very bottom, the user attaches their code for the assignment and finally asks their question: “Can you please help me?” Examining this question, there is once again nothing to it. The user did not state anything about what issue they encountered or what they are having trouble with. The lack of smart aspects in this post is reflected in the flag at the top of this post stating that it has been closed due to not meeting Stack Overflow guidelines. Comparing this to the smart question above, anyone would be more likely to help the user who posted the smart question.

After looking through a wide range of questions on Stack Overflow, it’s clear that some are phrased better than others. While there are still questions that may not be very smart, yet are still popular, it’s evident that any vague question, especially one about homework, will not result in the answer that you’re looking for.
